# chip8

Simple (work in progress) chip8 emulator written in C++11 using SDL implemented per [Cowgod's Chip-8 Technical Reference v1.0](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM#Ex9E) and [CHIP-8 Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8).

## What's left?
* Delay and sound timers
* 8xxx instructions (bit shift operations)
* Several Fxxx instructions (notably: waitkey and BCD operation as well as those associated with the built-in timers)
* More command line options (toggle verbose output)
* Identify/fix bugs
